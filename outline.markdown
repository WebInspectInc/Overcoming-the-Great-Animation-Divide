## Conveys meaning
## Makes things more useable
## Makes things more memorable
## Delights users (last goal)
  * when something is delightful, it makes us *want* to do it (Twitter star animation). Still serves a function

# But Animation has problems

## Animation is hard to think about
Animations always tend to fall into two categories: too much or too little.
There seems to be this divide on the web: either you're like a flash website, and have crazy-nuts animations EVERYWHERE, or you have no animations at all. Very few websites fall into the "tasteful animations" gap.

## Animation is hard technically
Jerky, laggy animations are a thing. Ill-thought out animations are also a thing. We need to fix both of those things.

# A solution for lag
Brief explanation of FLIP tactics, touch on WAAPI, and give CSS or JS code example for current animation
