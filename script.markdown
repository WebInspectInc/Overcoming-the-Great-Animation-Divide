Good evening everyone, my name is Timothy Miller, and as you might guess from my slides I'm here to talk about animation.

So animation is important. And I'm not necessarily talking about ol' Steamboat Willie up there, who gave rise to many animated masterpieces, I'm talking about animations in the interfaces that we build as JavaScripters and web developers, animations that help people to see the important things that they need to see.

As a lot of you have probably figured out, building web apps is pretty challenging. There are a lot of pieces that go into it! Not only do we have to wear a lot of hats, but we constantly juggle our hats, trying to chose the right one for the right time. There's also one really weird, quirky hat in our arsenal. Very few people wear it, and of those people even fewer know how to wear it correctly. That hat is animation. (bring a weird hat to wear during this part?)

So let's dig a little bit into what makes a good animation. There are a lot of factors at play, and it isn't always easy to say whether an animation is a good one or a bad one. Here are a few ideas.

Good animation conveys meaning. It isn't there just to be cool or flashy, it actually has a purpose. This form has some flashy animations, and they all add up to be one cohesive experience that feels *real*. Also the button turns into a loader, which tells you that it's doing something.

Bad animation distracts from the task at hand. Hover animations are guilt of this a *lot*. People slap an animation on there because it's cool, and they don't really think about what the animation does, or what purpose it serves. In this case, all the animation does is distract the user, it's jerky and clunky and pointless.

Good animation improves useability. As you can see, these little bubbles animate in whenever they're created, which calls just a tiny bit of attention to the fact that it's new. It's subtle, which is a good thing, it makes it useful but still ignorable.

On the other hand, bad animation slows users down. This is a game on an iPhone, and anytime I adjust the volume it covers up a third of my screen. Plus it stays there for three seconds before it animates out, which means that the other zombie standing behind this zombie has plenty of time to kill my friend in a hat here. Sadness.

Good animation creates memories. Honestly, this is my favorite part of this whole talk, because I love watching this overlay explode. I could do that all day. It's fun, and that's a good thing.

Bad animation creates frustration. I'm picking on iOS again, mainly because Apple isn't afraid to use animation like most people seem to be. As you can see, after unlocking this phone it takes 3 or 4 seconds before you can actually use the phone. You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but when you use this phone 27 times a day like most teenagers that 4 seconds adds up.

So I show you all of these examples for more than one reason. First off I want you to start thinking about animation a little more, because it's important. Second, I want you to see how difficult this is. I mean, two of my bad examples come straight from Apple. If Apple can't get animation right, then what hope do we have, right?

Well, Apple can—and does—get animation right, just not all the time. Their animations are part of why their higher-ups all look like Scrooge McDuck here. And the good news is that it’s never been easier to animate on the web, and it’s just going to get easier from here.

The Web Animation API is coming! It isn't here yet, but it's a brilliant idea that will bring much more intuitive and performant animations to the web. But it's going to take a year or two before we can actually start using this, so you have two options. You can be like this lazy cat, or you can learn a thing or two about animating with the tools that we *do* have.

My recommendation: don't be like that fat cat. Be like Scrooge McDuck, grab the bull by the horns. Learn a thing or two about animation, and I can practically guaruntee that it will pay off. Instead of that ginger, be like this cat. He may not be a racoon, but he's trying his best, and at first glance you can't even tell the difference. You may not be an animator, but learn a few basic principles and you can be. And the web will be a better place for it.
