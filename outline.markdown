# Animation is important

## Conveys meaning
## Makes things more useable
## Makes things more memorable
## Delights users (last goal)
  * when something is delightful, it makes us *want* to do it (Twitter star animation)

# But Animation has problems
Animations always tend to fall into two categories: too much or too little.
There seems to be this divide on the web: either you're like a flash website, and have crazy-nuts animations EVERYWHERE, or you have no animations at all. Very few websites fall into the "tasteful animations" gap.
